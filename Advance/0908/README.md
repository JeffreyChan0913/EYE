### Problem 1
##### time limit per test case: 1 second 

One day, Jeffrey is so into number. He wants to know, from a sequence of number, $A$, which value occurs the most from the given sequence. 

Help Jeffrey to find that value.

1. first value is a positive integer that denotes as the number of test cases.
2. each test case will start with a positive integer that indicates the size of $A$, wehre the size is $1 \leq size \leq 200000$.
3. followed by, the values for $A$, where $1\leq a_i \leq 10e9$.

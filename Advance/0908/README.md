Help Jeffrey to find that value.

1. first value is a positive integer that denotes as the number of test cases.
2. each test case will start with a positive integer that indicates the size of $A$, wehre the size is $1 \leq size \leq 10e9$.
3. followed by, the values for $A$, where $1\leq a_i \leq 10e9$.

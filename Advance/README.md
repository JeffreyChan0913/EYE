For this term, we will split things into two main areas: 
1. Apply the concepts we have learned to solve problems.
2. Incorporating new functions calls or algorithms to efficiently manage our data.

Our learning will heavily rely on the following foundational knowledge:

1. array / vector
2. data types
3. loops
4. math
5. logic

It might seem like we are covering only five major topics, however; it is important to note that the over all the USACO Bronze level is built upon these fundamental concepts. 

In each session, we will engage in problem solving exercise. If we are unable to complete it during class, it will be assigned as your homework. Throughout our learning journey, we will not only focus on mastering coding techniques but also understanding the rationale behind our approach.
While your code might pass test case 1-8, however; inefficient code will not able to fluke test case 9 and 10. As a result, we will occasionally delve into the efficiency of our code and explore alternative approaches to ensure the solutions are robust. 

Albeit I am not privy to your schedule, here is my routine for interview preparation as a PhD student (time units are measured in weeks).

1. $\approx 20$ hrs dedicated to work 
2. $\approx 35$ hrs of TA duties 
3. $\approx 15$ hrs allotted for research and TA meetings
4. $\approx 40$ hrs spent on research activities
5. $\approx 15$ hrs for errands
6. $\approx 15$ hrs for problems solving - $\approx 3$ problems a day 
7. $\approx 5$  hrs of sleep per day
8. $\approx 10$ hrs of feeding and walking my dogs, cats, and stray cats. 
9. $\approx 8$  hrs for meals (lunch or dinner). 

I don't anticipate people to mirror my level of motivation, however; if one passionate about certain goals, one will fuel themself and extranal padding is not necessarily.

If aiming for futher achievement, consider these independent resources: 
1. AtCoder - ABC contest - problem A,B,C, and / or D.
2. CodeChef
3. USACO

Please note that additional practice is udnertaken independently and won't be covered in class unless time permitted.

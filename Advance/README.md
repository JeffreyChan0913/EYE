<h2 align="center">Syllabus</h2>

For this term, we will split things into two, solve problem with what we have learned and some new function calls or algorithms to manage our data. 

We will be heavily depending on the following knowledge: 

1. array / vector
2. data types
3. loops
4. math
5. logic

It seems like only 5 big topics, but the entire USACO Bronze are really based on these 5 topics. 

Each session, we will work on problem solving, if we cant finish it during class, it will be your homework. We will often time not just learning how to code, but also learn why we are doing things at a particular way. Your code might pass test case 1 - 8, however; if your code is slow, you will not pass test case 9 or 10. So, sometimes, we will be looking at the performance of the code why you are learning certain things at a different way and why your approach might not be the best. 

Albeit I don't know your schedule, here is my routine that prepare myself for interview as a PhD student (unit is in week).

1. $\approx 20$ hrs of working
2. $\approx 35$ hrs of TA Duty
3. $\approx 15$ hrs of research and TA meetings
4. $\approx 40$ hrs of research
5. $\approx 15$ hrs of errands
6. $\approx 15$ hrs of problems solving - $\approx 3$ problems a day 
7. $\approx 5$  hrs of sleep per day
8. $\approx 10$ hrs of feeding and walking my dogs, cats, and stray cats. 
9. $\approx 8$  hrs of eatting lunch / dinner

I am not expecting you to have the same motivation as me, however; if you are eager to do certain things, you dont need anyone to push you to reach your goal. If you wnat to reach certain things, you need to fuel yourself, not me. 

To do more problems, you can work on Atcoder - ABC problem A,B,and C, CodeChef, and USACO on your own. I will or will not go over your problems unless we have extra time.

You dont have to buy it. You can use similar material as reference. Good to have those books but it is not mandnatory.

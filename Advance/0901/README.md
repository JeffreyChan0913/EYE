## Hashing

The idea of hashing is really the following. 

We want to use the least amount of time to access a particular element. For example, there is an event in your school, what it does is we layout 10,000 boxes on the hallway. The instruction states that, there are **TWO** blue keys inside two separated boxes. What you need to do is you need to
find the two keys inorder to get \$100,000.

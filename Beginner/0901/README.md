###Lets do problems related to vector 

1. Define a vector with 10 elements, fill it with $1 2 3 4 5 \dots  10$, and then print out the entire vector.
2. Print the odd element: ```1 3 5 7 9```
3. Print the even element in reverse ```10 8 6 4 2```

4. You are asked to help your professor to create a light weight calculator to calculate the average for the class. You were told that no one get lower than 77 and of course, maximum value we can get is 100. Output one number that is the average.

First number, n, will represent how many grades you have to calculate, and the next n values will be the grades.

Example: 

input:
```
5
88 99 87 76 80
```

output:
```88.5```

From the input, first number is 5 that tell us that we are expecting 5 numbers. Then, we have 5 numbers follow along that are ```88 99 87 76 80```. As a result, we need to find average from that 5 numbers. 

Test case:
Input1:
```
5 88 99 87 76 80
```
Output:
```
88.5
```

Input2:
```
10 32 76 67 77 87 89 100 101 33 1
```
Output2:
```
88.25
```

Input3:
```
33 41 134 120 -66 -99 -1 27 1 67 191 69 105 -23 116 -26 -81 22 -37 -56 35 196 42 -68 183 53 28 82 31 189 42 -94 97 186
```
Output:
```
89.5
```

### The Math Language

There are few math terms one might want to learn in advance. 
1. $1e9$, is equal to 1,000,000,000. To remember this, $e9$ is basically saying I have nine zeros.
2. $2e9$, is basically saing, i have nine zeros and it starts at 2. Therefore, 2,000,000,000.
3. $10e9$, this is saying i start with 10 and there is nine zeros at the back. Therefore, 10,000,000,000.
4. $\in$, this symbol is saying
	1. part of
	2. in

	Exmaple: A is a vector that is defined as follow: ```A = {1,2,3,4,5}```. Now if we have an integer variable ```k``` and it has a value of 3. Then we can say $k \in A$ because $k=3$ and the $vector A$ does contain the value $3$ thats why we are saying $k\in A$.
5. $\notin$ is the opposite of $\in$. Example: if we define an integer $m$ and set it to -5. Since the vector $A$ does not contain the value of $-5$, therefore; we can say $m \notin A$. 

### Lets do problems related to vector 

Incase you need some reference, you can use this [LINK](https://github.com/JeffreyChan0913/EYE/tree/main/Beginner/0825)

1. Define a vector with 10 elements, fill it with $1 2 3 4 5 \dots  10$, and then print out the entire vector.
2. Print the odd element: ```1 3 5 7 9```
3. Print the even element in reverse ```10 8 6 4 2```

4. You are asked to help your professor to create a light weight calculator to calculate the average for the class. You were told that no one get lower than 77 and of course, maximum value we can get is 100. Output one number that is the average.

First number, n, will represent how many grades you have to calculate, and the next n values will be the grades.

Example: 

input:
```
5
88 99 87 76 80
```

output:
```88.5```

From the input, first number is 5 that tell us that we are expecting 5 numbers. Then, we have 5 numbers follow along that are ```88 99 87 76 80```. As a result, we need to find average from that 5 numbers. 

Test case:
Input1:
```
5 88 99 87 76 80
```
Output:
```
88.5
```

Input2:
```
10 32 76 67 77 87 89 100 101 33 1
```
Output2:
```
88.25
```

Input3:
```
33 41 134 120 -66 -99 -1 27 1 67 191 69 105 -23 116 -26 -81 22 -37 -56 35 196 42 -68 183 53 28 82 31 189 42 -94 97 186
```
Output:
```
89.5
```

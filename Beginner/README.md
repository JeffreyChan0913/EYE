<h2 align="center">Syllabus</h2>

For this term, we will split things into two main areas: 
1. Apply the concepts we have learned to solve problems.
2. Incorporating new functions calls or algorithms to efficiently manage our data.

Our learning will heavily rely on the following foundational knowledge:

1. array / vector
2. data types
3. loops
4. math
5. logic

It might seem like we are covering only five major topics, however; it is important to note that the over all the USACO Bronze level is built upon these fundamental concepts. 

Each session involves problem solving. Unfinished tasks become homework.

1. W01-W04 Problem solving with vectors and loops. Introducing new vector function calls. 
2. W05-W07 Problem solving with vectors and loops. Focusing on writing a functions. 
2. W08-W12 Problem solving with arrays and loops. Emphasizing array maniplulation.  
3. W13-W15 Problem solving with array like structures and hashing. Learning effective array usage. 
4. W15-W17 Problem solving with array like structures and their algorithms. Exploring advanced function calls for specific structures. 
5. W18-W24 Problem solving what we have learned from W1-W17. Solving both easy to intriciate bronze problems including math and logic challenges.

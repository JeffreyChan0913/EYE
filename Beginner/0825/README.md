Basic template to run a c++ code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
	cout << "Hello World\n";
}
```

1. ```#include <iostream>```: This is how we include a particular tool to our code.
2. ``using namespace std;```: when we use most of the functions or methods, we will need to type ```std::``` infront of a particular functions or methods, to alleviate the amount of typing, we use this line of code to tell the computer that, if a particular functions or methods is used, you will help me to include ```std::``` in front of it. 
3. ```int main() { ... } ```: this is where we start our code. 
4. ```cout << ```: is basically putting what ever after ```<<``` into the buffer, so the computer will get what ever in the buffer and put it to the screen.
5. ```"Hello World\n"```: this is a string. To identify a string, we use ```"```. So if something is being sandwhiched with a```"```, that is a string. As for ```\n```, it is saying print a newline after ```Hello World```.
